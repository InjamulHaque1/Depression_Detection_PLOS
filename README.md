# Depression_Detection_PLOS

To enhance the robustness and generalizability of our machine learning models, we combined both the BSMDD and the Facebook Dataset into a unified dataset named Screening Dataset. This merged dataset integrates the linguistic diversity and contextual richness of two distinct sourcesâ€”one carefully translated and annotated from English Data (BSMDD), and the other organically sourced from real-life Bengali social media posts via Facebook. The combined dataset consists of 22,631 samples, with 21,910 entries from BSMDD and 721 entries from our custom Facebook dataset. Each entry is annotated with a binary label: 0 for non-depressive and 1 for depressive. By including both crowdsourced and web-scraped content, the dataset benefits from a balanced representation of both clinically relevant depressive expressions and everyday social sentiments expressed in Bengali. This unified dataset allows for more comprehensive model training and evaluation, facilitating better screening of depressive cues across formal and informal textual styles. The inclusion of naturally occurring language from Facebook posts ensures the models are not only trained on translated mental health expressions but also grounded in the native Bengali context.
